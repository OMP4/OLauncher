# OLauncher
A custom Launcher for Minecraft written in WinForms .NET for C#.

### DISCLAIMER
This uses the Windows Registry to save Username and Password data!<br />
The values "username" and "password" will be stored in WinReg at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\OMP4\OLauncher<br />
I will update it to save Username and Password data safely in about 3-5 buissnes days ;)

### Release Date
A public beta of OLauncher will be released when the main Launcher Function works!
